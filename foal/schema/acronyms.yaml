            Dictionary of acronyms.
            Acronyms do not have to be in their own file, and
            acronyms do not have to be in YAML.
            The data must be in this structure to parse.

        type: map
        mapping:
            '=':
                desc: |
                    Acronym as used in a doc source, such as "cpu".

                    Automated tools use tool-specific syntax, such as "[!cpu]"
                    or "{{cpu}}, to recognize acronyms.
                    The specific syntax varies based on the automated tool.

                    Acronyms are case-sensitive within data
                    because most tools treat case differently.

                    shortform:
                        desc: |
                            Short form of the expanded acronym, such as "CPU".
                        required: true
                        type: str
                    longform:
                        desc: |
                            Expanded form of the abbreviation,
                            such as "Central Processing Unit".

                            The first instance of "[!cpu]" in the doc is
                            automatically expanded to "<longform> (<shortform>)".
                            Example:
                            "[!cpu]" expands to
                            "Central Processing Unit (CPU)" on first occurrence and
                            "CPU" on other occurrences.
                        required: true

                        desc: |
                            Any other metadata about the acronym.
                            This allows to extend the schema for other purposes.
